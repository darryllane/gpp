        Originally the vulnerability was reported in MS14-025 as 'The vulnerability could allow elevation of
        privilege if Active Directory Group Policy preferences are used to distribute passwords across
        the domain'. This was patched, however the issue is still exploitable for other preference
        options as long as they require authentication to execute.
        
        This script is used to gather the cpassword used in Group Policy Preferences and decrypt it regardless
        of the hosting xml file.
